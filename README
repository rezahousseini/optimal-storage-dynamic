To compile the files on an Ubuntu system with Octave and GLPK installed use on the terminal:
mkoctfile <filename> -lglpk -lQuadProgpp

- I added a file example.m, it explains the usage of the functions in a small example.
- The file solver.cc unifies the framework
- Inclusions in file solver.cc are:
	- init.h
	- linprog.h
	- slopeupdate.h
	- transition.h
	- utils.h
- Libraries used are GLPK and BOOST
- ADPoptimalNStorage.cc is the Octave interface
